    "- Defined inside a class (non-static).\n",
    "- Can access all members (including private) of outer class.\n",
    "- Needs outer class object to create\n",

    "\n",
    "- Declared inside a method, constructor, or block.\n",
    "- Scope is limited to that block.\n",
    "- Useful for helper tasks inside a method\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.3 Anonymous Inner Class**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Class without a name, created at runtime.\n",
    "- Used to implement an interface or override methods of a class quickly.\n",
    "- Very common in event handling (e.g., GUI, listeners).\n",

    "- Use inner classes only when they are tightly bound to outer class.\n",
    "- Prefer static nested class if inner class does not need access to outer class instance.\n",
    "- Use anonymous inner class for single-use implementations.\n",
