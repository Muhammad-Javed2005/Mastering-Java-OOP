    "# **Inheritance in Java – Complete Notes**\n",
    "========================================\n",
    "\n",
    "## *1. Definition:*\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming.  \n",
    "It allows one class (**child/subclass**) to acquire the **properties and behaviors** of another class (**parent/superclass**).  \n",
    "The main purpose of inheritance is **code reusability**, supporting the **“is-a” relationship**, and providing a structured hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## *2. Types of Inheritance in Java:*\n",
    "------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Inheritance**  \n",
    "   * A child class inherits from one parent class.  \n",
    "   * Supported in Java.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multilevel Inheritance**  \n",
    "   * A class inherits from a child class, forming a chain.  \n",
    "   * Supported in Java.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hierarchical Inheritance**  \n",
    "   * Multiple classes inherit from the same parent class.  \n",
    "   * Supported in Java.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multiple Inheritance**  \n",
    "   * A class inherits from multiple parent classes.  \n",
    "   * **Not supported in Java with classes** (to avoid ambiguity).  \n",
    "   * Achieved using **interfaces**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## *3. Important Concepts in Inheritance:*\n",
    "-----------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1 Superclass and Subclass**\n",
    "* **Superclass (Parent class)** → the class whose properties are inherited.  \n",
    "* **Subclass (Child class)** → the class that inherits the properties of the parent.  \n",
    "* Uses the **extends keyword** for inheritance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.2 super Keyword**\n",
    "* Used to refer to the parent class.  \n",
    "* Can be used for:  \n",
    "  * Calling parent class constructor.  \n",
    "  * Accessing parent class methods.  \n",
    "  * Accessing parent class variables (if shadowed).  \n",
    "* **Note**: `super()` must always be the **first statement** in a constructor if used.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.3 Constructor Chaining**\n",
    "* When a subclass object is created, its **parent class constructor** is automatically called first.  \n",
    "* Achieved using **super()** at the beginning of the child constructor.  \n",
    "* Ensures proper initialization of the object hierarchy.  \n",
    "* If not explicitly written, Java automatically inserts a call to the no-arg parent constructor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.4 Method Overriding in Inheritance**\n",
    "* Subclass can redefine parent class methods with the same signature.  \n",
    "* Supports **runtime polymorphism**.  \n",
    "* Overridden methods in the child class are executed at runtime depending on the actual object.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.5 Access Modifiers and Inheritance**\n",
    "* **Public members** → accessible everywhere.  \n",
    "* **Protected members** → accessible within the same package and by subclasses.  \n",
    "* **Default (package-private)** → accessible only within the same package.  \n",
    "* **Private members** → not inherited by subclasses directly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.6 Types of Members Inherited**\n",
    "* Variables and methods (according to access level).  \n",
    "* **Constructors are not inherited** but can be called using `super()`.  \n",
    "* **Static members** are inherited but:  \n",
    "  * They belong to the **class**, not the object.  \n",
    "  * They are **hidden** (not overridden).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.7 Final Keyword in Inheritance**\n",
    "* **final class** → cannot be inherited.  \n",
    "* **final method** → cannot be overridden in a subclass.  \n",
    "* Useful for preventing modifications and ensuring security.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.8 Interfaces and Inheritance**\n",
    "* Java allows **multiple inheritance** through interfaces.  \n",
    "* A class can implement multiple interfaces in addition to extending one class.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.9 Object Class in Inheritance**\n",
    "* In Java, **Object** is the **root superclass** of all classes.  \n",
    "* If no parent is specified, a class implicitly extends `Object`.  \n",
    "* Common methods from `Object`:  \n",
    "  * `toString()` – represents the object as a string.  \n",
    "  * `equals()` – compares two objects.  \n",
    "  * `hashCode()` – returns the hash code of the object.  \n",
    "  * `clone()` – creates a copy of the object.  \n",
    "* These methods can be **overridden** by subclasses to provide custom behavior.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## *4. Key Points / Functions to Remember:*\n",
    "------------------------------------------\n",
    "* **extends keyword** → used for inheritance between classes.  \n",
    "* **implements keyword** → used for implementing interfaces.  \n",
    "* **super keyword** → used to call parent constructor, methods, or variables.  \n",
    "* **Method overriding** → supported in inheritance.  \n",
    "* **Constructors** → not inherited but invoked through chaining.  \n",
    "* **Private members** → not accessible in subclasses.  \n",
    "* **final** → prevents inheritance or overriding.  \n",
    "* **Static methods** → inherited but resolved using reference type (method hiding).  \n",
    "* **Java supports single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance but not multiple inheritance with classes.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## *5. Advantages of Inheritance:*\n",
    "---------------------------------\n",
    "* **Code Reusability** → Child class reuses parent class code.  \n",
    "* **Extensibility** → New functionality can be added without modifying existing code.  \n",
    "* **Method Overriding** → Enables runtime polymorphism.  \n",
    "* **Organized Structure** → Provides clear hierarchical classification.  \n",
    "* **Maintenance** → Easier to maintain due to reduced redundancy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## *6. Real-Life Examples:*\n",
    "--------------------------\n",
    "* **Vehicle → Car → SportsCar** (multilevel inheritance).  \n",
    "* **Shape → Circle / Rectangle / Triangle** (hierarchical inheritance).  \n",
    "* **Payment System** → base class defines common methods, subclasses provide specific implementations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## *7. Common Pitfalls:*\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "* Overusing inheritance when **composition** is better.  \n",
    "* Assuming **private members** are inherited (they are not).  \n",
    "* Forgetting to call **super()** in subclass constructors when required.  \n",
    "* Trying to achieve **multiple inheritance** with classes (not supported).  \n",
    "* Making methods or classes `final` unintentionally blocks extension.  \n",
    "* Creating **deep inheritance chains**, making code harder to maintain.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## *8. Best Practices:*\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "* Use **inheritance only when “is-a” relationship truly exists**.  \n",
    "  (e.g., Car is a Vehicle ✅, but Car is not a Wheel ❌).  \n",
    "* Use **composition** (has-a relationship) if inheritance does not make sense.  \n",
    "* Always use **@Override annotation** when overriding methods.  \n",
    "* Keep parent classes **general** and subclasses **more specific**.  \n",
    "* Prefer **interfaces** for achieving multiple behavior inheritance.  \n",
    "* Avoid **deep hierarchies** to keep the code simple and maintainable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## *9. Summary:*\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "Inheritance in Java allows classes to derive properties and methods from other classes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* It promotes **code reuse, structure, and flexibility**.  \n",
    "* Supported forms: **single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance**.  \n",
    "* Multiple inheritance with classes is **not supported** but can be achieved using **interfaces**.  \n",
    "* The **extends**, **implements**, and **super** keywords play a key role.  \n",
    "* **Object class** is the root of all classes in Java.  \n",
    "* Correct use of inheritance improves maintainability, but misuse can lead to poor design.  \n",
