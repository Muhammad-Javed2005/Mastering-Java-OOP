    "# **Constructors in Java – Complete Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "## *1. Definition:*\n",
    "A **constructor** in Java is a special type of method that is used to initialize objects.  \n",
    "It is automatically called when an object of a class is created.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Constructor name **must be the same as the class name**.  \n",
    "- It does **not have a return type**, not even `void`.  \n",
    "- Its main purpose is to **initialize instance variables** of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## *2. Characteristics of a Constructor:*\n",
    "- Same name as the class.  \n",
    "- No return type (not even `void`).  \n",
    "- Called automatically when object is created using `new` keyword.  \n",
    "- Can be **overloaded** (multiple constructors in one class).  \n",
    "- Cannot be declared as `static`, `final`, or `abstract`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## *3. Types of Constructors in Java:*\n",
    "There are mainly **three types** of constructors in Java:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **A. Default Constructor:**\n",
    "- A constructor that has no parameters.  \n",
    "- If no constructor is defined in a class, Java automatically provides a default constructor.  \n",
    "- It initializes objects with **default values** (e.g., `0` for numbers, `null` for objects, `false` for boolean).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Syntax:*\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "class MyClass {\n",
    "    MyClass() {\n",
    "        // Default constructor\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Object created!\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **B. Parameterized Constructor:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A constructor that takes arguments (parameters).\n",
    "- Used to initialize an object with custom values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Syntax:*\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "class MyClass {\n",
    "    int x;\n",
    "    MyClass(int value) {\n",
    "        x = value;  // initialize variable\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **C. Copy Constructor (User-Defined in Java):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Java does not provide a built-in copy constructor like C++.\n",
    "- But it can be created manually by passing an object as a parameter.\n",
    "- Used to copy values of one object into another.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Syntax:*\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "class MyClass {\n",
    "    int x;\n",
    "    MyClass(MyClass obj) { // Copy constructor\n",
    "        x = obj.x;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Constructor Overloading:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Just like methods, constructors can also be overloaded.\n",
    "- Multiple constructors in a class with the same name but different parameter lists.\n",
    "- Helps in creating objects in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Key Points:*\n",
    "- - Differentiated by number, type, and order of parameters.\n",
    "- - Improves flexibility of object initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Constructor Chaining:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calling one constructor from another constructor in the same class or parent class.\n",
    "- Achieved using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- - *this()* → calls another constructor within the same class.\n",
    "- - *super()* → calls the parent class constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Rules:*\n",
    "- Constructor call (this() or super()) must be the first statement inside a constructor.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "| Purpose     | Initializes object                            | Defines behavior / performs task |\n",

    "## **7. Rules of Constructors:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. Name must be same as class name.\n",
    "- 2. Cannot have a return type.\n",
    "- 3. Can be overloaded but cannot be overridden.\n",
    "- 4. **this()** or **super()** must be the first statement if used.\n",
    "- 5. If no constructor is defined, compiler provides a default constructor.\n",
    "- 6. A constructor can have access modifiers (**public, private, protected, or default**).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **8. Private Constructors:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a constructor is declared as private, objects cannot be created outside the class.\n",
    "- Used in:\n",
    "- - Singleton Design Pattern (only one instance of a class is created).\n",
    "- - Restricting instantiation from outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **9. Static Constructors (Not in Java):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unlike C#, Java does not support static constructors.\n",
    "- But static blocks can be used to initialize static variables\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **10. Constructor with this Keyword:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Used to call another constructor from within a constructor.\n",
    "- Helps in reducing code duplication\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "class MyClass {\n",
    "    int x, y;\n",
    "    MyClass() {\n",
    "        this(10, 20); // Calls parameterized constructor\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    MyClass(int a, int b) {\n",
    "        x = a;\n",
    "        y = b;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **11. Constructor with super Keyword:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Used to call the parent class constructor.\n",
    "- Ensures that base class variables are initialized before subclass\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **12. Best Practices for Constructors:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep them simple and readable.\n",
    "- Use parameterized constructors to initialize important fields.\n",
    "- Avoid putting heavy logic inside constructors.\n",
    "- Use constructor chaining (this() / super()) for reusability.\n",
    "- If many parameters exist, consider using Builder Pattern instead of constructors\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Summary..**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constructors are special methods that initialize objects.\n",
    "- They do not return values, and their name matches the class name.\n",
    "- Types: Default, Parameterized, Copy.\n",
    "- Concepts: Overloading, Chaining, this(), super(), private constructors.\n",
    "- Constructors improve readability, flexibility, and ensure objects are properly initialized before use.\n",
