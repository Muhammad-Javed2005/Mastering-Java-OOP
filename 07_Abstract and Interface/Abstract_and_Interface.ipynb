    "# ðŸ“˜ **Abstract Class and Interface in Java**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Abstract Class**\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Definition:*\n",
    "- An **abstract class** in Java is a class declared with the `abstract` keyword.\n",
    "- It may contain **abstract methods** (without implementation) as well as **concrete methods** (with implementation).\n",
    "- It **cannot be instantiated directly** (you cannot create objects of it).\n",
    "- It serves as a **base class** to provide a common structure and behavior for subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Purpose:*\n",
    "- Used when classes share a **common base** but may provide different implementations for certain methods.\n",
    "- Acts as a **template** for other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Key Points:*\n",
    "- Declared using the `abstract` keyword.\n",
    "- Can contain:\n",
    "  1. Abstract methods (without body).\n",
    "  2. Concrete methods (with body).\n",
    "  3. Fields (variables).\n",
    "  4. Constructors.\n",
    "  5. Static methods.\n",
    "- If a class has at least one abstract method, it must be declared `abstract`.\n",
    "- Subclasses must either:\n",
    "  1. Provide implementation for all abstract methods, OR  \n",
    "  2. Be declared abstract themselves.\n",
    "- Cannot be instantiated directly (`new` keyword not allowed).\n",
    "- Can have **access modifiers** for methods and variables.\n",
    "- Can have **constructors** (used to initialize fields when subclass object is created).\n",
    "- Supports **single inheritance** (a class can extend only one abstract class).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract Methods\n",
    "- A method declared without a body and marked with the `abstract` keyword.\n",
    "- Must be inside an abstract class.\n",
    "- No curly braces `{}` â†’ only method signature ending with `;`.\n",
    "- Must be implemented in subclass unless subclass is also abstract.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constructors in Abstract Class\n",
    "- Abstract class can have constructors.\n",
    "- Constructors are invoked when a subclass object is created.\n",
    "- Useful for **initializing common fields**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access Modifiers\n",
    "- Abstract class and its methods can have **any access modifier** (`public`, `protected`, `private`).\n",
    "- Abstract methods are generally `public` or `protected` so subclasses can implement them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "- When you want to share some **common implementation** across subclasses.\n",
    "- When you need a **base class** with both defined and undefined behaviors.\n",
    "- When you want to enforce that subclasses must implement specific methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- Provides **partial abstraction** (mix of abstract and concrete methods).\n",
    "- Promotes **code reusability** by defining common logic in one place.\n",
    "- Serves as a good **base for polymorphism**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- Supports only **single inheritance**.\n",
    "- Cannot be instantiated directly.\n",
    "- If only method contracts are required (no implementation), **interface** is preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Interface**\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Definition:*\n",
    "- An **interface** in Java is a blueprint of a class.\n",
    "- It is used to achieve **full abstraction** and **multiple inheritance**.\n",
    "- Before Java 8: can only contain abstract methods.  \n",
    "- From Java 8 onward:\n",
    "  1. Default methods (with body).  \n",
    "  2. Static methods.  \n",
    "- From Java 9 onward:\n",
    "  3. Private methods (helper methods inside interface).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### *Key Points:*\n",
    "- Declared using the `interface` keyword.\n",
    "- By default, all methods are `public` and `abstract` (before Java 8).\n",
    "- By default, all variables are:\n",
    "  - `public`\n",
    "  - `static`\n",
    "  - `final`\n",
    "- A class implements an interface using the `implements` keyword.\n",
    "- A class can implement **multiple interfaces** (supports multiple inheritance).\n",
    "- An interface **cannot have constructors**.\n",
    "- Interfaces cannot maintain state (no instance variables, only constants).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *From Java 8+:*\n",
    "- **default methods** â†’ methods with a body inside interface.  \n",
    "- **static methods** â†’ can be called using the interface name.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### *From Java 9+:*\n",
    "- **private methods** â†’ for code reusability inside interface.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "- To define a **contract or capability** that multiple classes can implement.\n",
    "- For achieving **multiple inheritance of type**.\n",
    "- For achieving **loose coupling** between components.\n",
