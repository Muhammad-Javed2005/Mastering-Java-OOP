    "# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java – Complete Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Introduction:**\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**, which contain **data (fields/attributes)** and **behavior (methods)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Java is a **fully object-oriented programming language** (except primitive types).  \n",
    "OOP improves **modularity, reusability, scalability, and maintainability** of programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Key OOP Principles:**\n",
    "There are **four main pillars of OOP**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation** – Binding data and methods together into a single unit (class).  \n",
    "2. **Inheritance** – Mechanism of acquiring properties and behaviors of a parent class.  \n",
    "3. **Polymorphism** – Ability of a method, operator, or object to take multiple forms.  \n",
    "4. **Abstraction** – Hiding internal details and showing only essential features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Classes and Objects:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### *A. Class:*\n",
    "- A **blueprint** or template for creating objects.  \n",
    "- Defines **attributes (fields)** and **behaviors (methods)**.  \n",
    "- Does not occupy memory until objects are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Syntax:**\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "class ClassName {\n",
    "    // fields (variables)\n",
    "    // methods (functions)\n",
    "}\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "### *B. Object:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- An instance of a class.\n",
    "- Represents a real-world entity (e.g., Student, Car, Employee).\n",
    "- Created using the new keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>ClassName obj = new ClassName();</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Encapsulation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encapsulation means wrapping data (variables) and methods into a single unit (class).\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Key Points:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- - Achieved by declaring variables as private and providing public getters/setters.\n",
    "- - Protects data from unauthorized access.\n",
    "- - Improves security and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Benefits:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- - Data hiding.\n",
    "- - Flexibility (validation in setters).\n",
    "- - Reusability\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Inheritance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inheritance allows a class (child/subclass) to acquire properties and methods of another class (parent/superclass).\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Key Points:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- - Achieved using the extends keyword.\n",
    "- - Promotes code reusability.\n",
    "- - Supports hierarchical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Types of Inheritance in Java:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- - **Single Inheritance** – One class inherits another.\n",
    "- - **Multilevel Inheritance** – A chain of classes (A → B → C).\n",
    "- - **Hierarchical Inheritance** – Multiple classes inherit from a single parent.\n",
    "- - **Multiple Inheritance** (via Interfaces) – Achieved using interfaces (since Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Polymorphism:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Polymorphism = \"many forms\".\n",
    "- It allows a single entity (method, operator, or object) to perform different tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Types:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- - **Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- - - Same method name, different parameter lists.\n",
    "- - -Resolved at compile time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- - **Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- - - Subclass provides its own implementation of a method in the parent class.\n",
    "- - - Achieved using inheritance and dynamic method dispatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Benefits:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- - Flexibility.\n",
    "- - Reusability.\n",
    "- - Cleaner and more understandable code\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **7. Abstraction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Abstraction = showing only essential details and hiding internal implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Achieved By:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- - Abstract Classes (abstract keyword).\n",
    "- - Interfaces (contain only abstract methods before Java 8, and default/static methods after Java 8).\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Benefits:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improves security by hiding unnecessary details.\n",
    "- Reduces complexity.\n",
    "- Focuses on what an object does, not how it does it\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
