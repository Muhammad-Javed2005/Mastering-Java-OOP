    "\n",
    "- - Multithreading is the process of executing multiple threads simultaneously to achieve concurrent execution.\n",
    "- - A thread is the smallest unit of a process that can run independently.\n",

    "### *Why use Multithreading?*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Efficient CPU utilization.\n",
    "- Improves performance by executing multiple tasks concurrently.\n",
    "- Useful for real-time applications like games, multimedia, and servers.\n",
